        The main aim of Furniture store management mini DBMS project is to keep a track of sales, purchases and their
        effect on inventory. We aim to demonstrate the use of create, read, update, and delete mys&L operations through
        this project. The project starts by creating a seller, then a customer, purchase some products from seller and
        note the changes for inventory. The purchased items can be modified later which demonstrates the update
        functionality of project. Finally we can record a sale and note the changes to product quality in inventory
